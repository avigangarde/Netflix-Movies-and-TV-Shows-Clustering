The biggest provider of on-demand online streaming media and online DVD movie rentals is Netflix. Marc and Reed founded it on August 29, 1997, in Los Gatos, California. Its 69 million users reside in more than 60 nations and watch more than 100 million hours of TV and videos each day. With access to TV shows, documentaries, and feature films in a broad range of genres and languages, Netflix is the top global provider of online entertainment. These straightforward, engaging, and exciting visualisations were made as a result of my curiosity to analyse the Netflix platform's newly released material in order to identify demographic groups that shared interests.
